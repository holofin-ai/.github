## What We Build

Holofin is an intelligent document processing (IDP) platform purpose-built for
financial services. We handle bank statements, invoices, tax forms, fund reports,
and other complex financial documents that legacy OCR tools get wrong.

**Core capabilities:**

- **AI extraction** — Tables, fields, and nested data from any financial document format
- **Fact grounding** — Every extracted value is traced back to its source, eliminating hallucinated outputs
- **Hololang DSL** — A purpose-built domain-specific language for defining document validation rules
- **API-first** — RESTful API and Docker-ready deployment for seamless integration

## Open Source
